### Launch a private community streaming website
### Inspired by https://github.com/Fenrirthviti/stream-site

I loved the work Fenrirthviti was doing with his streaming site, but i don't really like coding in PHP. So, i figured i would try building a MEAN based front-end. Crudboiz is using DeepStream for all the real-time content (chat, video players, stream lists).

#### This includes some really nice features like:

- Private Mode (disable streams from show up on the list)
- Emoji Chat (chat and feel free to use emoji icons!)
- Flash & HLS Players (Flash is faster but lower support in browsers)
- Mood Lighting (based on background images, generates a shadow to match the colors in the stream)

This requires some rigirous setup of a nginx-rtmp server that should be followed by going to Fenrirthviti's github posted above.
